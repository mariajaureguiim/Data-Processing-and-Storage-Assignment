Data Processing and Storage Assignment
Running the Code:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed:
Install a C++ compiler on your machine.
On Linux: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install g++
On macOS: xcode-select --install
On Windows: Use MinGW or install Visual Studio with C++ support.

2. Clone the GitHub repository:
 Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

3. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ code:
Change into the directory containing the C++ code.
cd your-repository

4. Compile the C++ code:
Run the compilation command.
g++ -o Main Main.cpp

5.Run the compiled code:
After successful compilation:
On Linux/macOS:./Main
On Windows:Main.exe
Observe the output:
Check the terminal or command prompt for the output of your C++ program.
Assignment Modification for Future Official Assignments

To enhance the assignment for future official use, consider the following refinements:

-Provide explicit examples for each method, demonstrating various scenarios and edge cases.
-Specify the behavior of methods in the presence of invalid inputs, guiding students on error handling.
-Clearly define the scope of a transaction. Specify whether a transaction can involve multiple key-value pairs and whether it is restricted to a single key.
-Consider providing a comprehensive documentation or comments for the provided example (Fig 2) to explain the expected outcomes and reasons for each function call. This will help in understanding the expected behavior.
-Clearly define how errors within a transaction should be handled. For instance, what happens if a put() operation fails within a transaction? Does it cause a rollback automatically, or does the transaction continue?
